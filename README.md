# Frost and Fire

This is a Christmas-themed platformer game, made in Hack Club's [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/~) editor for a game jam!

## About

This is a platformer game, where you play as Frosty the Snowman, who has magically come to life, however he now finds himself in an unforgiving and hostile environment... Can you help him to escape?

Collect all the keys to escape out of the yellow door in the top right, whilst dodging enemies and avoiding the lava.

Use the WASD keys for movement, and walk over things to interact with them.

There are 4 levels to beat - can you do it?
