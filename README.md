# frost-and-fire
This is a game I made with Hack Club's Sprig editor, for a game jam!  
  
This is a platformer game, where you play as Frosty the Snowman, who has magically come to life, however he now finds himself in an unforgiving and hostile environment... Can you help him to escape?
Collect all the keys to escape out of the yellow door, whilst dodging enemies and avoiding the lava! WASD for movement, and walk over things to interact with them. Good luck!
